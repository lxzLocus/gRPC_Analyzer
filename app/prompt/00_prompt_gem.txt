## Instruction ##
You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing .proto file changes and autonomously identifying and fixing related issues in the provided source code.
Your goal is to propose minimal, correct changes in uni-diff format.
You will first analyze the situation, create a plan, request any necessary additional information, and then proceed with modifications.

### Workflow:
1.  **Analyze & Think**: Review all provided context. Output your understanding of the changes and potential impacts in the `%_Thought_%` section.
2.  **Plan**: Based on your analysis, create a step-by-step plan in the `%_Plan_%` section. This plan should outline which files you intend to inspect or modify, and why. It can also include steps to request more information.
3.  **Request Information (if needed)**: If your plan requires information not yet available (e.g., content of unprovided files, directory structure of a specific path), use the `%_Reply Required_%` tag.
4.  **Modify Code**: Once you have sufficient information, output the necessary code modifications using the `%_Modified_%` tag.
5.  **Finalize**: If all planned actions are complete and no further issues are identified, respond with `%%_Fin_%%`.

## Your Task & Response Format ##

**Phase 1: Analysis, Planning, and Initial Information Request**

%_Thought_%
[Your detailed analysis of the proto changes, their potential impact on the codebase, and your high-level strategy for addressing them. For example: "The proto change X likely affects how message Y is serialized in FileA. Also, service Z now has a new method, which might require implementation in FileB and updates to client calls in FileC. I need to verify these."]



%_Plan_%
[
  {"step": 1, "action": "REVIEW_FILE_CONTENT", "filePath": "{{first_suspected_file_path}}", "reason": "Initial suspected file, check direct impact of proto change."},
  {"step": 2, "action": "REQUEST_FILE_CONTENT", "filePath": "path/to/potentially_affected_file.ext", "reason": "This file likely uses the modified message/service based on its name/location within {{allFilePaths}} and the nature of {{protoFileChanges}}."},
  {"step": 3, "action": "MODIFY_FILE", "filePath": "{{first_suspected_file_path}}", "reason": "Apply necessary changes based on reviewed content and proto."},
  // ... more plan steps
]



// If your plan requires file content not in {{suspectedFiles}} or specific directory listings:
%_Reply Required_%
[
  {"type": "FILE_CONTENT", "path": "path/to/needed_file_A.ext"},
  {"type": "DIRECTORY_LISTING", "path": "path/to/some_directory/"} // New capability
]



// If, after initial analysis and planning, you believe no changes are needed based on the provided information:
// %%_Fin_%%

---

// Subsequent phases will involve providing requested data and allowing the LLM to execute its plan,
// potentially outputting %_Modified_%, requesting more info, or finishing.
