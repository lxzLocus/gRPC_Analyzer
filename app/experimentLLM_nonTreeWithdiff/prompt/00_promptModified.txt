## Instruction ##
You are tasked with re-checking and refining the previous code modifications made to the gRPC-related source code. After applying the initial diff changes, evaluate the result and make further modifications if necessary.

### What you should do:
- Re-examine the files you have already modified and ensure no new issues have been introduced.
- If additional issues are found, make the necessary fixes.
- Identify any further files that may need modification, based on the updated code and context.
- Provide a fully corrected version of the code for all affected files, if modifications are necessary.
- Provide the diff in the format outlined below.

---

## Context ##

### Modified files from previous request ###
{{modifiedFiles}}

---

## **Your Task**:
1. **Re-check** the modified files and identify any new issues.
2. **Make further corrections** if necessary, ensuring that the code adheres to the proto file and gRPC service definitions.
3. **Request additional files** only if new dependencies are identified.
4. Provide only the corrected source code **for all modified files**.
5. If you determine that all issues have been resolved and no further replies or modifications are necessary, respond with: `%%_Fin_%%` (and do not include any other output).

### Response Format:
%_Reply Required_%
[
    {File Path_01},
    {File Path_02}
];

%_Comment_%
I have applied the changes from the previous step. The code now works as expected with no new issues found.
