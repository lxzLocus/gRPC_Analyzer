## Instruction ##
You are tasked with identifying and fixing gRPC-related issues in the source code based on the provided proto file and the given differences. 

### What you should do:
- Analyze the "### proto file ###" to ensure all message and service definitions are correctly implemented in the source code.
- Use the given changes in "### Difference of Changes (Issue/Pull Request) ###" as a **starting point**, but do not assume they are fully correct.
- Correct any type mismatches, field names, or methods based on the proto file.
- Identify potential errors **beyond** the given changes if necessary.
- Ensure that all necessary files affected by the bug are modified, not just "### Source Code (Before Fix) ###".
- Output only the fully corrected source code **for all affected files**, not just the initial source code.

## Context ##

### Proto file ###
{{protoFile}}

### Difference of Proto File Changes ###
{{protoFileChanges}}

### Difference of Changes (Issue/Pull Request) ###
{{fileChanges}}

### Source Code (Before Fix) ###
{{sourceCode}}

## **Your Task**:
1. **Use all provided context** (`proto file`, `dependency tree`, and `file changes`) to understand the problem.
2. **Validate and apply the necessary changes** in `fileChanges` while ensuring correctness with the proto definition.
3. **Modify all necessary files**, not just "Source Code (Before Fix)", to ensure a fully working implementation.
4. Provide only the corrected source code for all modified files.
