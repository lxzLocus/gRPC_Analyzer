## Instruction ##
You are tasked with identifying and fixing gRPC-related issues in the source code based on the provided proto file and the given differences. 

### What you should do:
- Analyze the "### proto file ###" to ensure all message and service definitions are correctly implemented in the "### source code ###".
- Use the given changes in "### difference of changes ###" as a **hint**, but do not assume they are fully correct.
- Correct any type mismatches, field names, or methods based on the proto file.
- Identify potential errors **beyond** the given changes if necessary.
- Handle exceptions properly based on the updated proto file structure.
- Output only the corrected source code with no additional explanations.

## Context ##

### Proto file ###
{{protoFile}}

### Dependency Tree of Proto ###
The following is a representation of how this proto file relates to other parts of the codebase:
{{dependencyTree}}


### Difference of Proto File Changes ###
The following differences show modifications made to the proto file(s), which might have caused gRPC-related issues:
{{protoFileChanges}}


### Difference of Changes (Issue/Pull Request) ###
The following differences represent modifications made to fix the bug. **However, these changes may not be entirely correct.** Your task is to analyze them and determine if further corrections are needed.
{{fileChanges}}


### Source Code (Before Fix) ###
This is the current (possibly buggy) implementation before the changes:
{{sourceCode}}

## **Your Task**:
1. Use the provided proto file and its dependency tree to understand the overall structure.
2. Analyze the changes in "difference of changes" and "difference of proto file changes" to identify what **might** have caused the bug.
3. **Do not blindly trust the given changes**â€”verify their correctness and modify them as needed.
4. Provide only the corrected source code as output.
