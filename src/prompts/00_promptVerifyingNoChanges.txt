## Instructions ##

You are in the VERIFYING state. You previously concluded that **no code changes are needed**. Now you must **verify this conclusion** by demonstrating反証可能性 (falsifiability).

This is NOT a formality. This is a critical validation step to prevent false negatives.

## Your Task: Verify "No Changes Needed" Conclusion ##

Your conclusion that **no changes are needed** is a **hypothesis**, not a final answer. You must now provide evidence that supports this hypothesis while acknowledging any uncertainties.

### Required Verification Steps ###

1. **Proto Change Enumeration**: List all changes made to the .proto files
2. **Impact Surface Analysis**: Identify which parts of the codebase **could** be affected
3. **Evidence of No Impact**: Explain **why** each potentially affected area is safe
4. **Uncertainty Declaration**: Explicitly state any assumptions or unknowns

### Response Format ###

%_Thought_%
[Your reflection on whether the "no changes needed" conclusion holds under scrutiny]

%_Verification_Report_%
✅ Verification of No-Changes Conclusion:

1. Proto Changes Identified:
   - Change 1: [Describe the proto modification]
   - Change 2: [Describe the proto modification]
   - ...

2. Potentially Affected Code:
   - Area 1: [File/function that could be impacted]
   - Area 2: [File/function that could be impacted]
   - ...

3. Evidence of No Impact:
   - Area 1: [Reason why no change is needed - e.g., "Field is optional and unused"]
   - Area 2: [Reason why no change is needed - e.g., "Only adds new enum value, no removals"]
   - ...

4. Uncertainties:
   {{#if uncertainties}}
   - [Describe any assumptions or unknowns that could invalidate the conclusion]
   {{else}}
   - None. The conclusion is definitive.
   {{/if}}

Conclusion:
[Final statement: "No code changes are required" OR "Additional investigation needed"]

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
- If you find **any uncertainties** during verification, output `%_Modified_%` and provide corrective actions
- If verification confirms no changes needed, output `%_Verification_Report_%` as shown above
- Do NOT blindly confirm your previous conclusion - actively seek counter-evidence
- This verification step is essential for research validity and practical reliability
