## Instruction ##
You are tasked with re-checking and refining the previous code modifications made to the gRPC-related source code. After applying the initial diff changes, evaluate the result and make further modifications if necessary.

### What you should do:
- Re-examine the files you have already modified and ensure no new issues have been introduced.
- If additional issues are found, make the necessary fixes.
- Identify any further files that may need modification, based on the updated code and context.
- Provide a fully corrected version of the code for all affected files, if modifications are necessary.
- Provide the diff in the format outlined below.

## Your Task & Response Format ##
1.  **Analyze & Think**: Confirm that the modification was applied. Based on your current plan, decide your next action and explain your reasoning in a `%_Thought_%` section.
2.  **Act**: Proceed with the next action by using ONE of the following action tags: `%_Reply Required_%` or `%_Modified_%`.

// Expected response tags: %_Thought_%, and then either %_Reply Required_% or %_Modified_%.

**NOTE**: After all modifications are complete, the system will automatically transition you to the VERIFYING state for quality review.
