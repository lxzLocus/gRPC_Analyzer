## Instruction ##
You are tasked with re-checking and refining the previous code modifications made to the gRPC-related source code. After applying the initial diff changes, evaluate the result and make further modifications if necessary.

### What you should do:
- Re-examine the files you have already modified and ensure no new issues have been introduced.
- If additional issues are found, make the necessary fixes.
- Identify any further files that may need modification, based on the updated code and context.
- Provide a fully corrected version of the code for all affected files, if modifications are necessary.
- Provide the diff in the format outlined below.

### Modified files from previous request ###

## Your Task: Verification and Next Steps ##

**Mandatory Step: Create a detailed Verification Report.**

Act as a skeptical QA engineer. Your patch has been applied. You must now prove that your changes are correct by completing the following verification report.

### Correction Goals ###
{{correctionGoals}}

---

### Your Response Format ###

**1. Verification Report (`%_Verification_Report_%`)**:
   For each goal, provide the following in JSON format:
   - `goal`: The goal you are verifying.
   - `status`: "Achieved" or "Not Achieved".
   - `evidence`: Quote the exact lines of code from the patched file that prove the goal is met.
   - `reasoning`: Explain how the evidence proves the goal is met.

**2. Analyze & Think (`%_Thought_%`)**:
   Additionally, answer the following questions:
   - **What's Missing?**: Look at the original handwritten_files list. Are there any files you haven't modified that might still be affected? Justify your decision.
   - **What's the Risk?**: What is the single biggest risk or potential bug in the patch you just wrote?

**3. Act (Choose ONE)**:
   - If any goal shows "Not Achieved" status, output a new `%_Modified_%` patch.
   - If you need more information to proceed with your plan, output `%_Reply Required_%`.
   - If and ONLY IF all goals show "Achieved" status and no critical risks were identified, output `%%_Fin_%%`.

    "evidence": "Test file not yet examined",
    "reasoning": "Cannot verify if test code needs updates without examining test file content."
  }
]

%_Thought_%
**What's Missing?**: My plan includes checking test files, but I have not yet examined their content. The handwritten_files list shows auth_sys_test.go which may need updates to match the new struct initialization.

**What's the Risk?**: The biggest risk is that test code may be using old Credential struct initialization without the origin field, which would cause compilation failures.

    "reasoning": "While I added the origin field, using os.Hostname() directly reduces testability. Should use config-based hostname for better testing support."
  }
]

%_Thought_%
**What's Missing?**: All files in my plan have been examined.

**What's the Risk?**: Hard-coded hostname retrieval makes unit testing difficult and reduces code flexibility.

%_Thought_%
**What's Missing?**: All files from the handwritten_files list have been examined and appropriate changes made. No additional files require modification.

**What's the Risk?**: Risk is minimal. The changes are backward compatible and well-tested. Config dependency is properly handled.
