## Instruction ##
You are tasked with re-checking and refining the previous code modifications made to the gRPC-related source code. After applying the initial diff changes, evaluate the result and make further modifications if necessary.

### What you should do:
- Re-examine the files you have already modified and ensure no new issues have been introduced.
- If additional issues are found, make the necessary fixes.
- Identify any further files that may need modification, based on the updated code and context.
- Provide a fully corrected version of the code for all affected files, if modifications are necessary.
- Provide the diff in the format outlined below.

### CRITICAL: Complete Impact Analysis ###
**You MUST ensure your changes are complete. Partial fixes are NOT acceptable.**

1. **Function Signature Changes**: If you changed a function's parameters or return type:
   - ✓ You MUST update ALL callers of that function
   - ✗ Leaving callers unchanged will cause compile errors
   - Request additional files with %_Reply Required_% if you need to see callers

2. **Struct/Message Field Changes**: If you added or modified fields:
   - ✓ You MUST update ALL struct initializations
   - ✓ You MUST update serialization/deserialization code
   - ✗ Missing initializations will cause runtime bugs

3. **Interface Changes**: If you modified an interface:
   - ✓ You MUST update ALL implementations
   - ✗ Inconsistent implementations will cause compile errors

4. **Value Propagation**: When a proto adds a new field:
   - ✓ Trace the field from origin to destination (client → server → handler → storage)
   - ✓ Update ALL layers that handle this data
   - ✗ Skipping layers will cause the value to be lost

## Your Task & Response Format ##
1.  **Analyze & Think**: Confirm that the modification was applied. Based on your current plan, decide your next action and explain your reasoning in a `%_Thought_%` section.
2.  **Act**: Proceed with the next action by using ONE of the following action tags: `%_Reply Required_%` or `%_Modified_%`.

// Expected response tags: %_Thought_%, and then either %_Reply Required_% or %_Modified_%.

**NOTE**: After all modifications are complete, the system will automatically transition you to the VERIFYING state for quality review.
