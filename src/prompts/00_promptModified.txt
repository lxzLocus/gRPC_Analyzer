## Instruction ##
You are tasked with re-checking and refining the previous code modifications made to the gRPC-related source code. After applying the initial diff changes, evaluate the result and make further modifications if necessary.

### What you should do:
- Re-examine the files you have already modified and ensure no new issues have been introduced.
- If additional issues are found, make the necessary fixes.
- Identify any further files that may need modification, based on the updated code and context.
- Provide a fully corrected version of the code for all affected files, if modifications are necessary.
- Provide the diff in the format outlined below.

### Your Current Plan ###

### Modified files from previous request ###

## Your Task: Verification and Next Steps ##

**Mandatory Step: Verify your work against the Correction Goals.**

You previously generated a patch which has now been applied. Review the code in `### Modified files from previous request ###` and verify if it fully satisfies EACH of the **Correction Goals** you defined at the start of this task.

### Correction Goals (Your original success criteria) ###
{{correction_goals}}

---

### Your Response Format ###

**1. Analyze & Think (`%_Thought_%`)**:
   - For each goal in the checklist above, explicitly state whether your modification achieved it (e.g., "Goal 1: Achieved.", "Goal 2: Partially achieved, still need to...").
   - If a goal is not fully met, or if your patch introduced a new problem, explain the issue.
   - Based on this verification, decide your next action (refine the patch, modify another file from your plan, or finish).

**2. Act (Choose ONE)**:
   - If further modifications are needed based on your verification, output a new `%_Modified_%` patch.
   - If you need more information to proceed with your plan, output `%_Reply Required_%`.
   - If and ONLY IF all Correction Goals have been fully met and your plan is complete, output `%%_Fin_%%`.

## Response Structure Example ##

// --- EXAMPLE 1: Further information is required ---

%_Thought_%
Verification against Correction Goals:
- Goal 1: 'Update `Credential` struct usage in `auth_sys.go`.' -> Achieved. The patch correctly adds the `origin` field during initialization.
- Goal 2: 'Ensure no build errors in C code.' -> Achieved. My previous analysis confirmed the C files did not require changes.
- Goal 3: 'Update related test code.' -> Not Achieved. My plan includes checking test files, but I have not yet examined their content.

My next action, according to my plan, is to analyze the test file to see if it needs updates. I will request its content now.

%_Reply Required_%

// --- EXAMPLE 2: Further modification is needed ---

%_Thought_%
Verification against Correction Goals:
- Goal 1: 'Update `Credential` struct usage.' -> Partially Achieved. I added the `origin` field, but I realize now that the hostname should be retrieved from a config variable, not directly from the OS, for better testability.

I will generate a new patch to correct this.

%_Thought_%
Verification against Correction Goals:
- Goal 1: 'Update `Credential` struct usage.' -> Achieved.
- Goal 2: 'Ensure no build errors in C code.' -> Achieved.
- Goal 3: 'Update related test code.' -> Achieved. The test file did not require any changes.

All correction goals have been met and all steps in my plan are complete. The task is finished.
