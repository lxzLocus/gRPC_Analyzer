## Instructions ##

You are in the VERIFYING state. The system detected that you **reached a no-progress state** during exploration. This means:
- You did not produce a modification (`%_Modified_%`)
- You did not explicitly conclude "no changes needed" (`%_No_Changes_Needed_%`)
- The system exhausted exploration attempts without clear resolution

This is **NOT the same as "no changes needed"**. This is a **fallback verification** to understand why progress stopped and whether the task is truly complete or requires different approach.

## Your Task: Diagnose No-Progress Situation ##

You reached this state because the system detected **semantic stagnation**—repeated requests for the same information or inability to produce a concrete action. You must now **explain why** and determine the **actual status**.

### Required Analysis Steps ###

1. **Exploration Summary**: What did you investigate?
2. **Blocking Factors**: What prevented you from producing a modification?
3. **Conclusiveness**: Can you definitively state "no changes needed" or is this "unable to determine"?
4. **Missing Information**: What information would have allowed you to proceed?

### Response Format ###

%_Thought_%
[Reflect on why you could not produce a modification or explicit conclusion]

%_Verification_Report_%
🔍 No-Progress Diagnostic Report:

1. Exploration Summary:
   - Proto Changes Identified: [List what changes you found in .proto files]
   - Code Areas Investigated: [List files/functions you examined]
   - Approach Taken: [Describe your investigation strategy]

2. Blocking Factors:
   {{#if blockedByMissingInfo}}
   - Missing Information: [What files/context you needed but couldn't access]
   {{/if}}
   {{#if blockedByComplexity}}
   - Complexity: [What made the change too complex to handle]
   {{/if}}
   {{#if blockedByUncertainty}}
   - Uncertainty: [What ambiguities prevented clear action]
   {{/if}}
   {{#if blockedByOther}}
   - Other: [Describe the blocking factor]
   {{/if}}

3. Actual Status:
   {{#if noChangesNeeded}}
   ✅ **Definitive Conclusion: No Changes Needed**
   Reason: [Explain why no changes are required despite no-progress state]
   Evidence: [Provide evidence supporting this conclusion]
   {{else if unableToDetermine}}
   ⚠️  **Unable to Determine**
   Reason: [Explain why you cannot reach a definitive conclusion]
   Required: [What would be needed to make a determination]
   {{else if needsDifferentApproach}}
   🔄 **Requires Different Approach**
   Issue: [Explain why current approach didn't work]
   Suggestion: [Suggest alternative approach or tool]
   {{/if}}

4. Missing Information Analysis:
   - Information Gaps: [List specific gaps that blocked progress]
   - Would More Context Help?: [Yes/No and explain]
   - Alternative Strategies: [What other approaches could work]

5. Final Assessment:
   Decision: [Choose ONE]
   - [ ] No changes are needed (provide evidence above)
   - [ ] Unable to determine without additional information
   - [ ] Modification is needed but couldn't be produced (explain why)
   
   Confidence: [Low/Medium/High]
   Recommendation: [What should happen next - accept as no-change, retry, manual review, etc.]

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
- **Distinguish** between "no changes needed" and "unable to produce changes"
- If you NOW realize changes ARE needed, output `%_Modified_%` with the patch
- If you can definitively conclude no changes needed, state so clearly with evidence
- If you're uncertain or blocked, acknowledge it honestly—this is valuable diagnostic information
- The goal is **transparency** about why progress stopped, not forcing a conclusion
- Your honesty helps improve the system and research validity

## Decision Points ##

After your analysis, choose ONE of these paths:

1. **If you NOW see what needs to be changed**:
   Output `%_Modified_%` with the patch

2. **If you're certain no changes are needed**:
   State this clearly in verification report with evidence

3. **If you're uncertain or blocked**:
   Acknowledge this in verification report with detailed explanation
   
In ALL cases, output `%_Verification_Report_%` following the format above.
