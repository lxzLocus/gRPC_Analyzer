## Final Quality Review ##

As a senior developer, perform one final quality review and create a comprehensive verification report:

1. **Solution Completeness**: Verify that every correction goal has been properly addressed with concrete evidence from your code changes.

2. **Code Quality**: Review all changes to ensure the solution is robust, maintainable, and well-integrated with existing patterns.

3. **Edge Case Coverage**: Identify and verify that edge cases and unusual scenarios are handled appropriately.

4. **Future-Proofing**: Assess whether your changes align with the codebase architecture and avoid creating technical debt.

### QUALITY VALIDATION EXAMPLES ###

✓ **gRPC Integration Excellence**: 
   - Example: If you changed a service method signature, ensure the .proto file, server implementation, and client calls all work harmoniously
   - Check: Do all components integrate smoothly without conflicts?

✓ **Error Handling Excellence**:
   - Example: If you enhanced error handling in function A, ensure all callers benefit from the improved error information
   - Check: Are error messages clear and helpful for debugging?

✓ **Interface Design Consistency**:
   - Example: If you refined an interface method, verify ALL implementations work harmoniously with the improvements
   - Check: Do test implementations also reflect the enhanced design?

✓ **Configuration Robustness**:
   - Example: If you added a new configuration field, ensure it has sensible defaults and proper validation
   - Check: Are related configuration files and documentation appropriately updated?

🔍 **Option 2 - All Goals Verified Complete**:
```
%_Verification_Report_%
✅ All correction goals have been achieved:
- Goal 1: Implemented proper error handling in auth_sys.go (lines 98-105)
- Goal 2: Enhanced hostname validation (lines 102-104)
- Goal 3: Updated all caller sites to handle new error responses

Code Quality Assessment:
- ✓ Follows existing patterns and conventions
- ✓ Edge cases properly handled (empty hostname, nil config)
- ✓ No technical debt introduced
- ✓ Future-proof design with clear error messages

The solution is ready for production.

## Response Instructions ##

**--- If all tasks are complete ---**
Provide a detailed verification report:
```
%_Verification_Report_%
✅ Summary of what was achieved
✅ Evidence for each correction goal
✅ Code quality assessment
✅ Edge case coverage confirmation
```

**--- If you find a final issue that needs fixing ---**
Provide your thoughts and the necessary modification:
```
%_Thought_%
[Explain what issue you found during verification]

%_Modified_%
[Your final improvements here]
```

**IMPORTANT**: After providing the verification report, the system will automatically complete the task. Focus on creating a comprehensive verification report that documents what was achieved.

Upon final review, I noticed that the error handling in auth_sys.go doesn't properly validate the hostname parameter, which could lead to empty origin fields in production...
