## Final Quality Review ##

As a senior developer, perform one final quality review:

1. **Solution Completeness**: Verify that every correction goal has been properly addressed with concrete evidence from your code changes.

2. **Code Quality**: Review all changes to ensure the solution is robust, maintainable, and well-integrated with existing patterns.

3. **Edge Case Coverage**: Identify and verify that edge cases and unusual scenarios are handled appropriately.

4. **Future-Proofing**: Assess whether your changes align with the codebase architecture and avoid creating technical debt.

### QUALITY VALIDATION EXAMPLES ###

✓ **gRPC Integration Excellence**: 
   - Example: If you changed a service method signature, ensure the .proto file, server implementation, and client calls all work harmoniously
   - Check: Do all components integrate smoothly without conflicts?

✓ **Error Handling Excellence**:
   - Example: If you enhanced error handling in function A, ensure all callers benefit from the improved error information
   - Check: Are error messages clear and helpful for debugging?

✓ **Interface Design Consistency**:
   - Example: If you refined an interface method, verify ALL implementations work harmoniously with the improvements
   - Check: Do test implementations also reflect the enhanced design?

✓ **Configuration Robustness**:
   - Example: If you added a new configuration field, ensure it has sensible defaults and proper validation
   - Check: Are related configuration files and documentation appropriately updated?

If you have verified that:
- All correction goals are demonstrably achieved (with specific evidence)
- The solution meets quality standards and handles edge cases properly
- No outstanding issues or gaps remain
- The code is ready for production

Then respond with ONLY:
```
%%_Fin_%%
```

If you identify any final enhancement opportunities, respond with:
```
%_Modified_%
[Your final improvements here]
```

**OPPORTUNITY**: This is your final chance to make your solution even better. Focus on excellence, not just correctness.

%_Thought_%
Upon final review, I noticed that the error handling in auth_sys.go doesn't properly validate the hostname parameter, which could lead to empty origin fields in production...
