# Template 5: Context Discrepancy Notification Prompt

## ⚠️ Context Warning: Discrepancy Between Provided Files and Expected State ##

The files you requested have been modified in this commit.
Due to my operational constraints, I can only provide file contents from the **pre-change state (`premerge` state)**.

There may be discrepancies between the latest `.proto` definitions you have and the file contents I'm about to provide.
Recognizing this contradiction, please analyze the provided older version file contents and appropriately update/execute your plan to reach the final goal (post-change state).

## Latest Proto File Definitions ##
{{protoFile}}

## Proto File Changes ##
{{protoFileChanges}}

## Files Changed in This Commit ##
{{fileChanges}}

## File You Requested ##
**Note**: The following file content is from the pre-change state

{{fileVersionMismatch}}

## Additional Context Files ##

## Your Next Action ##
Considering the above discrepancies, please determine your next action:

1. **Differential Analysis**: Identify differences between the latest proto definitions and the provided old file contents
2. **Inference-based Completion**: Reasonably infer the post-change state and clearly state your reasoning
3. **Modification Plan Development**: Plan the changes needed to transition from the old state to the new state
4. **Implementation Proposal**: Present specific code modification proposals to resolve the discrepancies

Leverage this constraint to maximize your differential reasoning capabilities.
