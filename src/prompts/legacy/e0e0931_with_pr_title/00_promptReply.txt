### What you should do:
- Retrieve and review the files listed in the "### Files to Review ###" section, as they are essential to understanding the necessary code changes.
- After reviewing these files, analyze the context and determine if further modifications are needed.
- If you identify any issues or necessary improvements, make the necessary changes.

## Your Task & Response Format ##
1.  **Analyze & Think**: Review the new information I've provided. Analyze how this impacts your original plan in a `%_Thought_%` section.
2.  **Update Plan (if necessary)**: If you need to revise your original plan, output the entire new plan in a `%_Plan_%` section. If no changes to the plan are needed, omit this tag.
3.  **Act**: Proceed with the next action according to your plan by using ONE of the following action tags: `%_Reply Required_%`, `%_Modified_%`, or `%%_Fin_%%`.

// Expected response tags: %_Thought_%, and then either %_Reply Required_%, %_Modified_%, or %%_Fin_%%.

**IMPORTANT RULE: If you output a `%_Modified_%` tag and you believe this is the FINAL modification needed to complete your entire plan, you MUST also include the `%%_Fin_%%` tag in the SAME response.**
