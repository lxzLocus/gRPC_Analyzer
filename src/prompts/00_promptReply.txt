## Instruction ##  
You are tasked with retrieving and reviewing specific source code files that were necessary for the previous analysis. After analyzing these files, you will evaluate if additional changes or fixes are required based on the context provided.

### What you should do:
- Retrieve and review the files listed in the "### Files to Review ###" section, as they are essential to understanding the necessary code changes.
- After reviewing these files, analyze the context and determine if further modifications are needed.
- If you identify any issues or necessary improvements, make the necessary changes.
- Provide only the **full content** of the modified or newly retrieved files. 
- Do not include any other files unless they are specifically requested.

## Your Task & Response Format ##
1.  **Analyze & Think**: Review the new information I've provided. Analyze how this impacts your original plan in a `%_Thought_%` section.
2.  **Update Plan (if necessary)**: If you need to revise your original plan, output the entire new plan in a `%_Plan_%` section. If no changes to the plan are needed, omit this tag.
3.  **Act**: Proceed with the next action according to your plan by using ONE of the following action tags: `%_Reply Required_%`, `%_Modified_%`, or `%%_Fin_%%`.
    **Guideline for `%_Modified_%`**: Before generating a patch, you MUST re-verify that all variables, functions, and types you use are defined or imported within the provided code context. If a definition is not found, request additional files.

// Expected response tags: %_Thought_%, and then either %_Reply Required_%, %_Modified_%, or %%_Fin_%%.

**IMPORTANT RULE: If you output a `%_Modified_%` tag and you believe this is the FINAL modification needed to complete your entire plan, you MUST also include the `%%_Fin_%%` tag in the SAME response.**
