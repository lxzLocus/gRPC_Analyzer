## Your Task & Response Format ##
## Your Next Action ##
Review the new information in the `Context` section. In the `%_Thought_%` section, explain how this new information helps you proceed with your plan. Then, execute the next step of your plan by using one of the action tags (`%_Reply Required_%`, `%_Modified_%`, or `%%_Fin_%%`).
// Expected response tags: %_Thought_%, and then either %_Reply Required_%, %_Modified_%, or %%_Fin_%%.

**IMPORTANT RULE: After you output a %_Modified_% tag, the system will apply it and show you the result. You MUST wait for this verification step. Output %%_Fin_%% only in a subsequent turn after you have verified that all your Correction Goals have been met.**
