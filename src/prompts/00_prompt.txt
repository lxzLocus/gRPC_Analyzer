## Instruction ##
You are tasked with identifying and fixing potential gRPC-related issues in the source code. You will be provided with a list of file paths and some specific files where potential issues may exist. If additional files need to be referenced, indicate them with a "%_Reply Required_%" tag at the top of your response, followed by the file paths you wish to access.

### What you should do:
- Analyze the "### proto file ###" to ensure all message and service definitions are correctly implemented in the source code.
- Examine the files listed in "### Suspected Files ###" for potential issues, but note that no diffs will be provided.
- Correct any type mismatches, field names, or methods based on the proto file.
- Identify potential errors **beyond** the given suspected files if necessary.
- Ensure that all necessary files affected by the bug are modified, beyond just those listed in "### Suspected Files ###".
- Output only the fully corrected source code **for all affected files**, not just the initially provided files.

## Context ##

### Proto file ###
{{protoFile}}

### Proto file changes###
{{protoFileChanges}}

### Changed files ###
{{fileChanges}}

### List of All File Paths ###
{{surroundedFilePath}}

### Suspected Files ###
{{suspectedFiles}}

## **Your Task**:
1. **Use all provided context** (`proto file`, `dependency tree`, and `suspected files`) to understand the problem.
2. **Identify and correct potential issues** in the `suspectedFiles` using the proto definition.
3. **Request additional files** if necessary by marking "%_Reply Required_%" and listing the required file paths at the top of your response.
4. **Modify all necessary files** to ensure a fully working implementation.
5. Provide only the corrected source code for all modified files.
6. Modified files should be in unix diff format.
7. Do not write comments in "%_Reply Required_%" or "%_Modified_%". Comments within code are allowed.

I've reviewed the code and compared it with the proto definitions provided. 

I fixed 5 typos.
