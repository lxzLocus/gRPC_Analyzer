## Role and Goal ##
You are an expert software engineering researcher specializing in Automated Program Repair (APR). Your task is to evaluate a code patch generated by an AI agent against a ground truth (human-written) patch. Your evaluation must be strict and based on the provided academic criteria.

## Evaluation Criteria ##

### 1. Plausibility ###
- A patch is "Plausible" if it is syntactically correct and logically sound, such that it would likely pass a typical test suite.
- **To determine plausibility, you MUST verify the following checklist:**
    1.  **Syntactic Correctness**: Is the patch syntactically correct for the given programming language? (e.g., no missing brackets, correct keywords).
    2.  **Dependency Resolution**: Does the patch reference variables, functions, or classes that are defined or imported within the provided `Code Context`?
    3.  **Logical Soundness**: Does the patch introduce any obvious logical flaws or contradictions?

### 2. Correctness ###
- A patch is "Correct" if it is Plausible AND either **identical** or **semantically equivalent** to the Ground Truth Patch. Semantic equivalence is determined by the following rules (R0-R11):
    - **R0: Identical Patch**: The patch is identical to the developer's patch (ignoring formatting and comments).
    - **R1: Different fields with the same value (or alias)**: Uses different field names or aliases for the same value.
    - **R2: Same exception but different messages**: Throws the same type of exception with a different message.
    - **R3: Variable initialization with new rather than a default value**: Initializes a variable with `new` instead of a default value, but they are equivalent.
    - **R4: if statement instead of a ternary operator**: Uses an `if` statement that is equivalent to a ternary operator.
    - **R5: Unrolling a method**: Inlines the code of a method instead of calling it.
    - **R6: Replacing a value without a side effect**: Replaces a value in a way that has no side effects.
    - **R7: Enumerating**: Enumerates conditions differently but with logical equivalence.
    - **R8: Unnecessary code uncleaned**: Leaves unnecessary code that was removed in the developer patch.
    - **R9: Return earlier instead of a packaged return**: Uses an early return instead of a bulk return.
    - **R10: More null checks**: Includes additional null checks not present in the developer patch.
    - **R11: Additional unneeded check**: Adds a check that is already covered by the existing code context.
    - **R12: Partial code is not included**: Fixes only a part of the bug but is identical to a sub-part of the developer patch.
    - **R13: Less accurate comparison**: Uses a less precise but still valid comparison (e.g., float vs. double).
    - **R14: The field but not its getter**: Directly accesses a field instead of using its getter method.
    - **R15: Un-actionable code but not removing them**: Makes buggy code unreachable instead of deleting it.

## Your Task: Provide Evaluation in JSON Format

Based on all the provided information and the strict criteria above, provide your evaluation. Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object.

```json
{
  "plausibility_evaluation": {
    "is_plausible": true,
    "reasoning": "Plausibility check passed: 1. Syntactically correct. 2. All dependencies are resolved within the code context. 3. No logical flaws were introduced."
  },
  "correctness_evaluation": {
    "is_correct": true,
    "semantic_equivalence_level": "IDENTICAL", 
    "reasoning": "The agent's patch is identical to the ground truth patch, satisfying rule R0.",
    "semantic_similarity_rules_applied": ["R0"]
  }
}
```

### JSON Field Definitions

  - **is_correct**: `true` if the patch is plausible and meets at least one of the R0-R15 criteria.
  - **semantic_equivalence_level**:
      - `"IDENTICAL"`: If R0 applies.
      - `"SEMANTICALLY_EQUIVALENT"`: If one or more of R1-R15 apply.
      - `"PLAUSIBLE_BUT_DIFFERENT"`: If the patch is plausible but not semantically equivalent to the ground truth.
      - `"INCORRECT"`: If the patch is not plausible or logically flawed.
  - **semantic_similarity_rules_applied**: An array listing all R-rules that apply (e.g., `["R4", "R9"]`).
