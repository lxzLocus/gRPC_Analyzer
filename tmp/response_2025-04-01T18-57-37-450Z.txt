No modifications provided because it seems a deeper review of all related files is required. The existing information hints that issues might involve not just the implementation but also relationships and possible mismatches between protobuf definitions and protobuf-generated code (e.g., field names and enum values). Additional inspection of generated files like `smd.pb.go` and C/C++ code that might interact with protobuf messages is advised to ensure complete consistency.

Requesting more files related to protobuf compilation output and implementations interfacing directly with any changes will ensure comprehensive correctness for all derived and dependent code.
